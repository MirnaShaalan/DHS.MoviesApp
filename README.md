# DHS.MoviesApp

Note: I developed this task totally in a local machine, so you need to apply your own configuration on the app to run properly. 
For example: you need to change local host port and to make sure you have the correct connection string.
Also you must run the migrations to be able to.get the write mapping to the tables.
